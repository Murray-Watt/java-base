## Dependencies

I am currently using amazon corretto 11 as my JDK. I am not adverse to using other JDKs, but I am not highly motivated to do so.

*Apache Log4j 2 is used for logging.  It is a compile time dependency only.  
*The IDE needs to be configured to use it.
*Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code.  It is a compile time dependency only.  The IDE needs to be configured to use it.
*JUnit 5 is used for testing.  It is a test time dependency only.
